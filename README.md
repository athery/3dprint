# Welcome to my 3D print lair

Here I store the models I create using OpenSCAD, because it's just code. I'm a beginner though, so this is probably not state of the art.

I also store the STL files, and the printing settings I used to slice them on Cura to print them on my Ender 3 Pro.

## Projects so far

### Knives holder (still in progress)

A plate to store my knives vertically witout messing with the blades or magnetizing them. It will be supported by nice a wooden frame I'm planning on building.

### D&D 5E actions tracker (done)

A nice little object with simple moving parts to keep track of your action, movement, bonus and reaction, and **stop messing with'em**. An original idea of a friend, which turned out fun to do :)

More to come...
