# Welcome, traveler !

Here I store models my friends and I create and print.

## How files are organized

I use OpenSCAD for 3D modeling, because it's just code. I'm a beginner though, so this is probably not state of the art.

All projects include :
- **/CAD** folder containing the .scad source file(s)
- **/STL** folder containing the .stl model file(s)

Sometimes, I also add a **/CE3_GCODE** folder containing the gcode of my latest print on my for Ender 3 Pro.

## Projects you will find

### Knives holder (done)

A plate to store my knives vertically witout messing with the blades or magnetizing them. It will be supported by nice a wooden frame I'm planning on building.

### Actions tracker for D&D 5e or Héros & Dragons (done)

A nice little object with simple moving parts to keep track of your action, movement, bonus and reaction, and **stop messing with'em**. An original idea of a friend, which turned out fun to do :)

### Condition markers box for D&D 5e or Héros & Dragons (done)

A little concentric cylinder box to hold condition markers we place around the miniatures (stunned, grappled, etc.). It comes with an optional D&D ampersand logo on the box lid.

### Hit points tracker for D&D 5e or Héros & Dragons (work in progress)

A little object featuring 3 numbered wheels to keep track of your hit points.

### Spells and capacities slots tracker for D&D or Héros & Dragons (work in progress)

A board and a set of tokens to keep track of your slots, be it spell, powers, feats (...) and when you recover them (long reste, short rest).


More to come...


Happy printing !
