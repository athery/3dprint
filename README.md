# Welcome, traveler !

Here I store models my friends and I create and print.

## How files are organized

I use OpenSCAD for 3D modeling, because it's just code. I'm a beginner though, so this is probably not state of the art.

All projects include :
- **/CAD** folder containing the .scad source file(s)
- **/STL** folder containing the .stl model file(s)

Sometimes, I also add a **/CE3_GCODE** folder containing the gcode of my latest print on my for Ender 3 Pro.

## Projects you will find

### Knives holder (still in progress)

A plate to store my knives vertically witout messing with the blades or magnetizing them. It will be supported by nice a wooden frame I'm planning on building.

### Actions tracker for D&D 5E or HÃ©ros & Dragons (done)

A nice little object with simple moving parts to keep track of your action, movement, bonus and reaction, and **stop messing with'em**. An original idea of a friend, which turned out fun to do :)


More to come...


Happy printing !
